	<title>Importing from your hard disk</title>

    <p>To import photo files from your hard disk into Shotwell, just drag them from your file browser into the Shotwell window.</p>
    
    <p>Alternatively, click <guiseq><gui>File</gui><gui>Import From Folder...</gui></guiseq> and select the folder containing the photos you want to import. If you do not want Shotwell to recurse into subfolders while importing, you can uncheck the <gui>Recurse Into Subfolders</gui> checkbox on the bottom of the file dialog.</p>
    
    <p>Shotwell will ask whether you want to copy the photo files to your library folder (usually this is the <file>Pictures</file> folder in your home directory) or to import them in place without copying the files.</p>
    
    <p>If you hold down <key>Ctrl</key> while dragging photos in, Shotwell will copy the photos into your library folder without prompting.  Similarly, if you hold down <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Shift</key></keyseq> while dragging photos in, Shotwell will import the photos without copying them.</p>

    <p>Once the import is complete, you can select <gui>Last Import</gui> in the sidebar to see all photos successfully imported. The Events list will also show new entries for the dates corresponding to the imported photos.</p>
