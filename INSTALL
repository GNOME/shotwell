    Shotwell Installation
    ---------------------

    To build and install Shotwell, type the following commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

    * By default, Shotwell will install under /usr/local.  The configure script
      can customize the prefix directory.  Run ./configure --help for
      instructions and other installation options.
  
    * You may need to execute "make install" as root (i.e. sudo make install)
      if installing to system directories.

    * If you wish to try Shotwell before installing it, you may execute it
      directly from its build directory.  Note that certain desktop integration
      (such as being listed in an application menu) requires full installation.

    Once installed, Shotwell will be available on your desktop Applications
    menu under Graphics or Photography.
