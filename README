    Shotwell Photo Manager
    ----------------------
    
  * Introduction
    
    Shotwell is a digital photo manager designed for the GNOME desktop
    environment.  It allows you to import photos from disk or camera,
    organize them by keywords and events, view them in full-window or fullscreen
    mode, and share them with others via social networking and more.
    
    Visit https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Shotwell to read about the current state of
    Shotwell's development and to make sure you're running the latest version.
    

  * Installation & Licensing
    
    Please consult the INSTALL and COPYING files for more information.
    

  * Quick Start
    
    There are three ways to import photos: via drag-and-drop, from a digital
    camera, and from the File menu.
    
    * Drag-and-drop: Simply drag photos from your file manager and drop them
    onto the Shotwell window.  You may drag files or directories.  The photos
    will be imported into the library.
    
    * Camera: Connect your digital camera to your computer.  Shotwell will 
    detect it and list it in the sidebar.  When you select the camera, Shotwell 
    will load previews of each photo.  You may choose specific photos to 
    import or to import them all.
    
    Shotwell uses gPhoto to communicate with digital cameras.  If your camera 
    does not appear in Shotwell's sidebar or there is a problem importing
    photos, visit http://www.gphoto.org to see if it is supported.
    
    * File menu: Select File -> Import From Folder ... and select a directory
    from the chooser dialog box.  Shotwell will scan the directory and all
    sub-directories for photo files and automatically import them.
    
    Once your photos are in Shotwell's library, you can view, edit, and export
    them.  More features are planned, so check http://www.yorba.org/shotwell
    regularly for updates.
