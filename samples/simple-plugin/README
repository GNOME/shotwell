    simple-plugin
    -------------
    
    This sample plugin implements the barebones for a SPIT module that can be
    loaded by Shotwell at startupp.  However, because it implements no
    Spit.Pluggables, is does not actually extend Shotwell's functionality.
    
    Note that the Shotwell plugin developer headers must be installed prior
    to building simple-plugin.  This can be done from the source code like so:
    
    $ ./configure --install-headers
    $ make
    $ make install
    
    You probably need to be root prior to running "make install" ("sudo make
    install" or some variant).
    
    NOTE: simple-plugin's Makefile is *not* designed to install the plugin in
    a system directory.  Rather, it installs the plugin in the user's plugin
    directory (in ~/.gnome2/shotwell/plugins).  To build and install 
    simple-plugin:
    
    $ make
    $ make install
