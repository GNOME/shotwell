# Shotwell

Shotwell is an easy-to-use, fast photo organizer.
It allows you to import photos from your camera or disk, organize them by date and subject
matter, even ratings.  It also offers basic photo editing, like crop, red-eye correction,
color adjustments, and straighten.  Shotwell’s non-destructive photo editor does not alter
your master photos, making it easy to experiment and correct errors.

When ready, Shotwell can upload your photos to various web services, such as Flickr,
Google Photos, and more.

Shotwell supports JPEG, PNG, HEIF/HEIC, AVIF, TIFF, WebP, JpegXL, GIF, and a variety of RAW file formats.
